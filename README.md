# ModulSlider
Joomla module modifications  
  
Responsive Slider + customize text as HTML  


**Changelog**  
XML Layout / mod_reslider.xml  
Type 'editor' not working with text filter - text not added as overlay.   
-> Kept 'textarea', added fields that'll style the text in the backend with no user input  
   
**TO DO**  
/ Works with 'Links? No' only  
/ Custom style hooked somewhere?  
/ Customizable position relative bottom X % ? Because depends on amount of text.
